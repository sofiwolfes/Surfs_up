Module 9


## Overview of the statistical analysis:
We have been contracted by W. Avy, the chairman of a group of investors to analyze weather data (specifically for the months of June and December) so he could make and informed decision by deteminating which area in Hawaii would be more successful when opening an Ice cream & Surf store.

## Purpose of the analysis:
We will be analycing the island of Oahu (Hawaii) to determine if a business like the one they are planning to invest in, would be profitable year-round.

To do this, we would be using Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, Pandas and SQLAlchemy.
 
## Results:
We have retrieved the measurement of the temperatures for the months of June and December.

After that, we have converted those temperatures to a list, and created a Data Frame to generate as summary of the statistics for both months.

You can see the statistics below:

### Key differences in weather between June and December:

* We can see that the average temperature is higher in June
* Both the min and max temperatures are higher in June as well


## Summary:
The business proposed is in fact viable as the temperatures don't vary much and the weather is good for the activities they are planing to do.
